Schedule::command('app:example-command')
        ->withoutOverlapping() // wait for previous command to be finish
        ->hourly() // at every hour
        ->onOneServer() // at a single server in case there are multiple servers
        ->runInBackground(); // run as  background task

Question 5.B What is the difference between the Context and Cache Facades? Provide examples to illustrate your explanation


    Context Facade: is share and retrive information in request, jobs and commands.
    context:add =>  use context:add for adding information in key and value  
    context:get => use context:get for getting information  in key and value
    We can use context:add to add information in logging. Create a middleware and in handle  function
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        Context::add('url', $request->url());
        Context::add('trace_id', Str::uuid()->toString());
 
        return $next($request);
    }


    Question 5C: What's the difference between $query->update(), $model->update(), and $model->updateQuietly() in Laravel, and when would you use each?

    Answer: 
            $query->update(): Update using active record query
            $model->update(): Update Model data using Eloquent, retrive a item to be updated, populate the field and calls save method, return true if successful or false 
            $model->updateQuietly(): Does not trigger any observer after update.
